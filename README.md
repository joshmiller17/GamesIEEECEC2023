# Workshop on Computation Intelligence in Games and Special Session on Games
This workshop and the special session is organized in association with the IEEE CIS Games Technical Committee (GTC).

**Organisers:**  
- Hamna Aslam, ([hamna025@gmail.com](mailto:hamna025@gmail.com))
- Marco Scirea, ([msc@mmmi.sdu.dk](mailto:msc@mmmi.sdu.dk))
- Josh Aaron Miller, ([miller.josh@northeastern.edu](mailto:miller.josh@northeastern.edu))


## Aim

Games are an ideal domain to study computational intelligence (CI) methods because they provide affordable, competitive, dynamic, reproducible environments suitable for testing new search algorithms, pattern-based evaluation methods, or learning concepts. Games scale from simple problems for developing algorithms to incredibly hard problems for testing algorithms to the limit. They are also interesting to observe, fun to play, and very attractive to students. Additionally, there is great potential for CI methods to improve the design and development of both computer games as well as tabletop games, board games, and puzzles. This special session aims at gathering leaders and neophytes in games research as well as practitioners in this field who research applications of computational intelligence methods to computer games.


## Scope

In general, papers are welcome that consider all kinds of applications of methods (evolutionary computation, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, (deep) reinforcement learning, fuzzy systems, game-tree search, rolling horizon algorithms, MCTS, etc.) to games (card games, board games, mathematical games, action games, strategy games, role-playing games, arcade games, serious games, etc.).

Examples include but are not limited to:
- Adaptation in games
- Automatic game testing
- Coevolution in games
- Comparative studies (e.g. CI versus human-designed players)
- Dynamic difficulty in games
- Games as test-beds for algorithms
- Imitating human players
- Learning to play games
- General game-playing, General game-learning
- Multi-agent, multi-strategy learning, and multi-agent evaluation
- Team AI, Cooperation of multiple agents
- Player/opponent modelling
- CI for serious games (e.g., games for health care, education or training)
- Results of game-based CI and open competitions
- Mathematical games and agents to play them
- Procedural content generation
- Automatic content generation
- Game and puzzle design with computational intelligence
- Representation of knowledge in player agents
- Game-related benchmark environments or data sets
- Game AI for real-world decision making and planning

## About the organisers

**Hamna Aslam** has a Ph. D. in Computer Science with a focus on user experience evaluation and affordance theory.
She researches digital and analog systems for their impact, desirability, and usability patterns. In this regard, AI
systems and games are the primary focus.


**Marco Scirea** is an Associate Professor in the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute at University
of Southern Denmark as part of the Game Development and Learning Technologies group.
He has a PhD in Affective Music Generation and its Effect on Player Experience as part of the
Center for Computer Games Research games at the IT University of Copenhagen.
His PhD research investigated the expression of moods and the affective effect this
mood-expressive music can have on the listener and applied this research to games: the final
objective was to create a system where, by using a cognitive model of the player, we would be
able to identify the player's emotional state and be able to reinforce or manipulate it through the
use of mood-expressive music to improve user experience.
What this research hopes to achieve is creating better immersive experiences (reinforcement of
current emotional state and playstyle) and help the designers create experiences where the
players are put in a specific emotional state (manipulation).


**Josh Aaron Miller** is a sixth-year PhD candidate at Northeastern University. His research
focuses on game-user interactions of transformational games â€” synthesizing game design
principles, industry best practices, and the psychology of learning and motivation to create
engaging user experiences in serious gaming contexts. He specializes in tutorial design and
complex learning.
